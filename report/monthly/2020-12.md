# TL;DR

December was a short month. Nevertheless, we've been making progress in the following main directions:

* Liveness for simple example protocol
* An inductive characterization for received/sent messages
* Making documentation more accessible through proof movies
* Framework for equivocation based on observations
* Common futures for List Validators protocol
* Refactoring of order-related type classes

Part of the work mentioned above has already been been succesfully merged into the main branch in the repository. Quantitatively, they represent ~2400 addeed lines and ~1400 removed lines, ~45 new definitions, 2 new classes, and 40 new lemmas being stated and proven.

# Work on Liveness

1. Discovered missing assumption in the spec requiring all participants to receive before advancing.

   Neither the validity condition on the validator transition nor the overall
   composition constraint prevented a validator from advancing their clock
   without having received all expected messages from other validators for
   the current timestep.
   This allowed liveness to fail by starvation, with a subset of validators
   advancing indefinitely while others never run, and never produce a quorum.
   
   For the simple example protocol no faults are tolerated, so it is
   sufficient to modify the validator VLSM definition to require that
   all expected messages are available before advancing the clock.
   Future work proving liveness of robust protocols will require
   finding a better solution.

1. Proved that clocks eventually advance

   This result mostly depends on proving that the candidate variant
   function which was already defined at the end of last month will
   decrease on every transition, if no validator has reached the
   target clock.
   Proving that a specific validator will advance uses this
   variant with an invariant that provides a limit on how far apart
   the clocks of different validators can be.
   This would not be true without the protocol change mentioned
   in the previous item.
   
   The proof that the variant decreases relies on several additional
   invariants.
   Some of the invariants recorded various properties of the behavior
   of the individual validators, such as that a validator only ever
   sent messages at times the plan says they were supposed to, and
   they have sent messages at all of those times which are earlier
   than their current clock.
   Another important invariant is the widely-useful fact that
   in any `no_equivocation` composition of VLSMs, any message
   recorded as `has_been_observed` in one component state must
   also have been sent, and duly recorded as `has_been_sent` in
   some component.

# Sent/Received/Observed messages

1. Added alternative (direct, inductive) characterizations for `has_been_sent` and `has_been_received` capabilities

1. Introduced `has_been_observed` as a new unifying capability 

# Documentation of the formalization

1. Proof movie generation is fully integrated with our current continuous integration process.

1. We added generation of a table of contents for proof movie files (corresponding to Coq files).

1. We are working with the maintainers of the proof movie tool (Alectryon) to fix bugs and
   incorporate other desirable facilities such as interlinking of names of theorems and definitions.
   In particular, we submitted a bug fix related to character set encoding that was accepted
   by the maintainer.

# Refactoring work on the definition of equivocation based on observations

1. The existing definitions assumed that the set of observations for a given 
state and validator is computable. This has been changed to bear closer
resemblance to the `has_been_sent`/`has_been_received`/`has_been_observed` 
predicates, i.e., a decidable relation between states and events.

1. The `subject_of_observation` was made partial to allow for events with no
subject (e.g., observations on an initial state). This is in line with the 
`sender` function for messages also being partial.

1. Existing definitions and results based on the previous definitions were 
updated to work with the new ones.

# Work on common futures for the List Validators protocol

1. Worked on proving that the common future state does not have more equivocators than
   the starting state. This is proven inductively, using a series of low-level lemmas
   which describe the relationship between observation sets before and after a single transition.
   A bit involved because of the (relatively) many types of observations.

1. Cleaned up and extracted some general utility results into separate PR's, to simplify 
   merging of the final PR.

# Refactoring of order-related type classes

1. Work continued on refactoring of some basic type classes related to orderings.
   Once finished, quite a few proofs may become shorter and more easy to maintain.
